# Smart Network Interface Cards for in-network AI Network Security

In this explorative diploma thesis I am investigating the capabilities of **Smart NIC's**, their integration with the hosting server, and the SDKs used for controlling the cards.

I am also implementing a case study of in-network computation harnessing the GPU of the **A30X**, in this case the computation involves machine learning-based **network traffic filtering**.
